- Chai aur code pe new video dekha kya?
- This is awesome. OpenAI rolled out an open weight model. Use it locally
- We did it again and this time it's on Udemy 
Over 36 hours of content on nodejs, authentication, ORMs, System Design and so much more. It took us months to build this resource. All of this is available at just 399 rs.

-Debugging se sabko dar lagta h ji, bs fark sirf itna h ki seniors ne vo error kaafi baar dekhe hote h n kuch 1st time dekh rhe hote h
-Aapka software useful kitna h, ye baat 1000x important h, vo open source h ya nhi vo baad ki baat h. 

Open source ke extra number tabhi count hote h jb software bhht heavily adopted ho ya kaafi revenue generating ho. 

Linkin aapko saara focus bs open source pe krna h, this is such a sad state of building right now. But koi na, hoga improvement eventually üòå
-Do what you do best and outsource rest. A great case study of BookMyShow and ImageKit.io 
As an engineer you want to do everything in-house but sometimes, it might not be the best option. Check out the latest video on English channel
- People underestimate the effort that it takes to build something or to achieve something. 

Bhht mhnt lagti h, us baad aansu aate h n uske baad b mhnt lagti h, aur daily lagti h. Aur aap soch rhe the ki 6 months effort me sab ho jayega. Vaha se to shuru hota h sab. 


Clicked this on phone, while I was in Japan.
- Hnjii, to aap Ai se darney waalo me se hain ya use karney waalo me se hai?
- We are building and this is going to be really really good. 

A lot of data insights, experience and people who are building in public gave us everything that we needed. 

Also, we are not grinding. Very relaxed, no hurry, with a mindset that it can be pushed next month too but we need high quality stuff. 

Lots of git commit. üòé
- YouTube pe b utna hi fun h playlist me jitna ki Udemy courses me h. Aap bs thoda consistent rho.
Baaki udemy courses ke liye hitesh.ai pe visit kro, coupons already laga rkhe h humne links pe.
- Hanji, 
timestamp b add kr diye h latest recursion video me. Mai btana bhul gya tha ki is video me Leetcode problems b h.
- Ye job role me dance kb add hua? ü´£
- Okay, I get it. We have crazy builders in this batch. Since every class in this batch refunds fees of 1 student, this is going to be tough to select. 
- There 2 types of competition in a classroom. One is elimination and another is raise the bar. 

While things like JEE are elimination by nature, coding is all about raising bar. There are no limited seats in coding, market is open to try your product and more than 1 product
- Baat to sahi hüòé
-I just love PhonePe approach. They studied everything about existing UPI apps. This included paytm, who thought we have 1st movers advantage. 

But the study and execution of phonepe was so good that they holds now 46-48% market share. 

You can start anytime and challenge
- I used to love this blue purple theme on website. AI killed it for me.


-Haan ji kaise ho sab log? Swagat hai aapka ‚ÄúChai aur Code‚Äù me. Aaj ke video me hum baat karenge ek badi hi khatarnaak bimari ke baare me. Bohot interesting bimari hai yeh ‚Äî kai logon ko lag chuki hai, shayad aapko bhi lagi ho‚Ä¶ ya phir aapke kisi college friend ko. Kisi na kisi ko to pakka lagi hai.

Is bimari ke baare me aaj hum jaanenge, samjhenge, aur dekhenge ki yeh theek kaise hoti hai. Best baat? Iske multiple stages hain ‚Äî Stage 1, Stage 2, aur ek stage aisa bhi aata hai jahan jaake yeh apne aap theek ho jaati hai. Matlab tension lene ki zarurat nahi.

Comment target rakha hai 1000, kyunki bimari serious hai. To chalo bina delay ke shuru karte hain aur aapko introduce karte hain is dangerous bimari se ‚Äî jiska naam hai: Superior Stack Syndrome.

Mujhe is syndrome ka idea ek LinkedIn message se aaya. Message me likha tha: ‚ÄúI am interested in Full Stack development but confused between normal Full Stack and Java Full Stack.‚Äù Mujhe laga ‚Äî normal Full Stack matlab? Aur yeh Java Full Stack superior kaise ho gaya?

Thoda research kiya, students se baat ki, aur pata laga ki haan ji, yeh ek syndrome hai.

Stage 1 ‚Äì College Validation

Stage 1 me banda mostly college me hota hai, aur apna ‚Äútech stack‚Äù choose karne ke liye seniors se validation leta hai.
Ek senior bolega ‚Äî ‚ÄúNode.js kar, best hai.‚Äù
Dusra bolega ‚Äî ‚ÄúNahi, Java kar. Mere internship Java se lagi hai.‚Äù
Teesra bolega ‚Äî ‚ÄúArre Java purana ho gaya, ab Python chal raha hai.‚Äù

Result? Banda wahi atak jaata hai jahan pe pehla ‚Äúbada naam‚Äù sun leta hai. Aur fir ban jaata hai Java fanboy ya JavaScript fanboy. Baaki stacks jaise Ruby on Rails, PHP ‚Äî unko outdated bolna shuru. Koi unke baare me baat kare to group chhod dena bhi normal ho jaata hai.

Stage 2 ‚Äì Online Validation

Ab college validation shift ho jaata hai online validation me. Banda YouTube gurus, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit pe ghoomta hai apne stack ka confirmation lene ke liye.

Problem? Jo stack choose kar liya hai, uske favour me hi content consume karega. Aur YouTube algorithm bhi wahi serve karega jo aap sunna chahte ho.

Example:
Koi YouTuber bolta hai ‚Äî ‚ÄúMain mostly JavaScript stack me kaam karta hoon, lekin baaki stacks bhi acche hote hain.‚Äù
Aapke dimaag me register hota hai sirf ‚Äî ‚ÄúJavaScript best hai.‚Äù
‚ÄúBaaki stacks bhi acche hain‚Äù ‚Äî yeh part ignore ho jaata hai.

Iss stage me ego boost milta hai: Mera stack hi superior hai.

Stage 3 ‚Äì Self Satisfaction Stage

Yeh stage thoda rare hai, kyunki yahan tak aane ke liye actually kuch build karna padta hai.
Banda apne stack me ek basic project banata hai ‚Äî jaise TODO app with authentication ‚Äî aur khud ko lagta hai duniya ka sabse bada product ban gaya.

Validation milta hai: ‚ÄúMera stack Netflix/Amazon use karta hai.‚Äù
Samajhna yeh hai ki wo companies sirf stack ki wajah se nahi chal rahi ‚Äî unke paas massive infra, multiple stacks, aur complex systems hote hain. Lekin yeh baat yahan register nahi hoti.

Positive side ‚Äî at least banda builder ban gaya hota hai.

Stage 4 ‚Äì Reality Slap

Yeh stage me bimari khatam ho jaati hai.
Banda apne build kiya hua product leke kisi company me join karta hai ya apne client ke liye kaam karta hai. Yahan pe introduction hota hai End User se ‚Äî jo product ke tech stack ki parwah nahi karta.

Usko farq padta hai: ‚ÄúKhana order kiya to time pe aaye.‚Äù
Na ki ‚ÄúButton ka corner radius kitna hai‚Äù ya ‚ÄúBackend Java me hai ya Node me.‚Äù

Yahan jaake samajh aata hai ki software development ek journey hai ‚Äî tools kuch bhi ho sakte hain: Java, Spring Boot, Express, WebSockets‚Ä¶ jo kaam kare, wahi best hai.

Moral:
Superior Stack Syndrome se bachna hai to jaldi se jaldi Stage 4 pe pohoncho.
Warning signs:

Lagta hai baaki sab outdated stacks use kar rahe hain.

Apne stack ka tattoo banwane ka mann karta hai.

Agar aisa lagta hai, to apne aas-paas ke actual senior developers se baat karo.
